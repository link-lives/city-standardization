# Standardization of all the places

* city_unification.ipynb : Provides a standardization for the variable Sogne in the data. In some cases those are street names. It is hard to parse unless it actually refers to a "Sogne" belonging to DigDag.

* birthplace_cleaning.ipynb : It attempts to clean and filter the birthplace variable (f√∏dested). It is more unstructured than city_unification's Sogne.
